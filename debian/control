Description: lightweight compositor for X11 (previously a compton fork)
 Based on xcompmgr, originally written by Keith Packard, with modifications
 from several contributors (according to the xcompmgr man page): Matthew Allum,
 Eric Anholt, Dan Doel, Thomas Luebking, Matthew Hawn, Ely Levy, Phil Blundell,
 and Carl Worth. Menu transparency was implemented by Dana Jansens.
